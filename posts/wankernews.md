p. I made "a juvenile website":http://wankernews.com!

p. So, maybe it requires some backstory? The fella behind "pinboard":http://pinboard.in/ "proposed":https://twitter.com/#!/Pinboard/status/155334419098517504 replacing instances of "the cloud" with "the moon", and further "proposed":https://twitter.com/#!/Pinboard/status/164847769285169152 replacing "hack" with "wank." Hilarious!

p. Well, over lunch with a few co-workers, we discussed how much "Hacker News":http://news.ycombinator.com might be improved with these replacements. So after work I dropped by a "wankathon":http://calagator.org/events/1250461751, threw together a rails app that proxies news.ycombinator.com with some regex replacements, and sent it off "to the moon":http://heroku.com.

p. Since then I've been laughing pretty much non-stop. Come wank the auto industry! Who are we to assign connotations to "wanker"? ahahaha
