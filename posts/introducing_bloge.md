I'd like to introduce you to my newest project, Bloge (pronounced like "doge"). It's a semi-static markdown blog generator written in Haskell, using the [Snap framework](http://snapframework.com/) and [Heist](https://github.com/snapframework/heist) HTML-rendering engine.

My previous blog was built using [Enki](https://github.com/xaviershay/enki), a Rails project built to mimic Wordpress. I was never super happy with it; in some ways it was overbuilt and in other ways it fell short. It used Textile for markup, and while Textile is a fine markup system, it never really stuck in my head the way Markdown has, so I was always looking up its syntax. It had a web-based post form, which seems nice, except I don't have a modal editor in my browser, so...in the end I was just dissatisfied.

I'm hoping this new built-from-the-ground-up system will make me much happier! :~)
